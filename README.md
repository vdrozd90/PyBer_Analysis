# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, youâ€™ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The results will provide an analysis of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

## Results: 
Urban has the highest amount of Total Rides (1,625) and Total Drivers (2,405), with the lowest averages for Fare per Ride ($24.53) and Fare per Driver ($16.57). Rural had the lowest amount of Total Rides (125) and Total Drivers (78), with the highest averages for Fare per Ride ($34.62) and Fare per Driver ($55.49). Suburban city type had Total Rides (625) and Total Drivers (490), with an averages for Fare per Ride ($30.97) and Fare per Driver ($39.50). 

## Summary:
Three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:
- Create a program to recruit new drivers in Rural and Suburban cities
- Once rural and suburban cities have more drivers, create an incentive program to get more riders.
- Create an incentive program for Urban city Riders. The number of Total Rides is significantly lower compared to the amount of Total Drivers
